            <p>Goal: <br /> Within these five months, I will complete the programming-hero course properly If there is any problem in this course, I will identify it and recap it again and I will revise this whole course again. Then I have a wish to learn JavaScript well After these works I will build up my school. I will look for circulars from various websites and apply for the job.<span></span></p>
            <p>How you will work hard to achieve your goal: <br /> <span>I will do my best to achieve the goals I have set in these 5 months. And to achieve this I have to work hard. And to achieve this goal I have to manage time very well. Because if I can't manage time then I can't complete it properly. Basically I have to overcome this challenge.</span></p>
